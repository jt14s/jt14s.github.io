          <p> I believe the life we have been given is much like a canvas. It is blank
              at the beginning, and by experiencing things we develop an artstyle which we
              use to paint over it. Our canvas is subjective, and much like we learn to adopt
              other styles, our canvas serves as a reference from which others will adopt. It
              is this canvas that has the potential to outlive us as our legacy.

        <section id="section-about-me">
          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p> Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Jorge, an entry-level software
              developer located in the Florida area. I graduated from the wondeful Florida State University,
              earning a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Communications. What I lack in
              experience I make up for in enthusiasm as I am always eager to learn new things relating to
              the field of Computer Science.
          </p>
          <p> Although my passion for the field didn't take off until later in my life, since the age of four I always knew I wanted to make
              videogames. What I didn't know at the time was that it was Computer Science that made my dream a reality, but once I learned that,
              it lead me down a path of intrigue regarding the field.
          </p>
          <p> My passion for Computer Science began at the tail end of my high school career. I began watching
              tutorials on YouTube about coding in Java, and although my interest at the time wasn't all that high,
              having this small insight on what coding was would help me later down the road. After graduating high school
              I attended a community college where they offered a Java course. I was nearing the end of my studies at the
              institution and I found myself being unsure as to what I wanted to pursue in terms of greater study. I decided to
              take the Java course and I was instantly hooked. After graduating from the community college I decided to attend
              a university in order to further learn about Computer Science. Fast forward two years and I had earned a degree in the field.
          </p>
          <p> Although my personal journey into the field of Computer Science began as one on course towards Game Development, I quickly realized
              that in order to reach my goal, I would first have to understand how to be a proficient programmer. I can't say for sure how proficient
              I've become over the years, but I can say I am a capable one at least. Throughout my studies I learned that there are many opportunities to
              be had with Computer Science, and as much as I wanted to run straight to Game Development, it was not so realistic. My studies focused mainly
              on business programming and not so much on game programming, but through my time learning I fell fond of the business type of work, and it is
              what I do for a living today. However, my passion for Game Design has not faltered, I take opportunities in learning about it when I can, and
              I have made several personal games to test my skills. I hope to one day open a game development company where I can create my visions.

          <h1>Projects</h1>

          <h2>Coding</h2>
          <p> I have a handfull of projects that I have worked on in the past. Most are open for viewing over at my github repository located
              <a href="https://github.com/jt14s" target="_blank">here</a>, but I will list some below, as well as projects that are not listed,
              but that I am currently working on behind the scenes:
          </p>

            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h2>Learning</h2>
          <p> Aside from actively coding projects, I also like to take some time to learn about programming languages that I do not know, and also
              tools that I find interesting. Below are the things I am currently learning:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Programming Languages</li>
              <ul>
                <li>GDScript</li>
                <li>HTML5</li>
                <li>CSS3</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>C#</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Tools</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Godot 3</li>
                <li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
                <li>Spring Framework</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>

          <h2>Other</h2>
          <p> Aside from Computer Science related things, I also have some ineterest in writing and drawing. I am currently(slowly) working on a
              high-fantasy novel called <cite>They Came with the Rain</cite>. I am also honing my drawing skills as I like to draw out the things
              that I write about. Slowly but surely these things will come to fruitinon.
